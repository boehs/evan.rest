      <p>It's just a personal API, there's nothing *particularly* deep, but I think it's super nifty. It:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Serves as layer for things which need persistance (ie: link shorteners)</li>
        <li>Serves as a way for the world to connect to me</li>
        <li>And me to connect to the world</li>
        <li>Is really cool! I mean, who can say they have their very own, personal API?</li>
      </ul>
